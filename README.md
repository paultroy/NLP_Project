# Project Overview

The goal of this project was to use NLP techniques to explore ski and snowboard jacket consumer written reviews. 

I wanted to see if there were different topics within the reviews text that might have been otherwise undetectable or extremely time consuming to document. 

Perhaps information gleaned from this analysis could be provided to product design departments at a ski jacket manufacturing company so that jacket design meets consumer demand (for example, pocket location and functionality on a ski jacket).

In total, the corprus is comprised of 5,118 written reviews scraped from Evo.com using BeautifulSoup.
